I'll be attending both the 2022 PCI Community Meetings (often abbreviated PCICM) in Toronto and Milan.

While the schedule is provided on each individual site and within the useful companion app, I wanted something to put in my calendar.

So I wrote a script (adapted actually, I had created it for last year's online meeting) and created 2 separate iCalendar (.ics) files which can be imported into regular calendar programs such as Outlook and Google Calendar.

* [PCICM North America in Toronto, Canada](/s/pcicm2022-na.ics)
* [PCICM Europe in Milan, Italy](/s/pcicm2022-eu.ics)

*Note: As a security profesional, I have to recommend you download the file, validate it (ics files are just text) and ensure it isn't malicious. They shouldn't be.*
