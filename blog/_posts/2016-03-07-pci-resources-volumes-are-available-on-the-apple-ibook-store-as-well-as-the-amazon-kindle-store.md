This post is just a summary of changes that have occured but that I've not yet blogged about.


Volumes 1 and 2 were released on the 
[Amazon Kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Yves-B.-Desharnais/e/B012KZCNTI) in July 2015.
The 
[PCI Resources Scoping Model and Approach](/pci-dss-scoping-model-and-approach), derived from volume 2 and published under a Creative Common license at the same time.
Volume 3 was released on the Amazon Kindle store in September 2015.


All 3 volumes were updated in January 2016 to reflect the 
[SSL/TLS changes published by the PCI SSC in December 2015](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/15_12_18_SSL_Webinar_Press_Release_FINAL.pdf).


All 3 volumes were published on the 
[Apple iBooks store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/yves-b.-desharnais/id1089327373?mt=11) in early March 2016.
