I just had the pleasure of presenting at BSides Calgary on the topic of "
Using NetFlow & Open Source tools for Network Behavioral Analysis". Thanks to the event organizers and volunteers for a great event!

While I await a link to the recorded presentation on Youtube, I want to publish as promised the 
[PDF of the slides](/s/BSides-Calgary-Netflow-20171022.pdf), a 
[ZIP of the source code](/s/20161019-code.zip), and a 
[PDF of the demo installation instructions](/s/BSides-Calgary-Netflow-Installation.pdf).
