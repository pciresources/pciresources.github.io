After many long hours over the last year, I am happy to announce the release of my first two volumes on PCI DSS compliance, the information security standard that covers credit card protection. 
[Volumes 1 and 2 are available on the Kindle store now](https://www.amazon.com/author/yvesbdesharnais), and I hope to have volume 3 out in September 2015.


Volume 1, A business case for the PCI DSS, explains why the PCI DSS standard matters, how it works, how we got here, and where it may be heading. Volume 2, PCI DSS Scoping, explains what (and why) people, processes and technologies must be subjected to PCI DSS controls. Volume 3 will cover how to build an information security program that takes PCI DSS into consideration.


This companion website to the book series is complete, but more information on the various PCI standards will be added over time.


I hope you find this information helpful.
