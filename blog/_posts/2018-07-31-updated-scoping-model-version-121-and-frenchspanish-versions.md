I'm happy to announce the release of the update for the 
[PCI Resources Scoping Model and Approach to version 1.2.1](/pci-dss-scoping-model-and-approach). The model is still available under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA).

The changes are minor and mainly reflect reference changes for PCI DSS 3.2.1 which came out late May 2018 (and mainly reflected the fact that announced date related changes are now mandatory).

With this version, I'm adding the French and Spanish versions of the model from the upcoming translations of the book which should be available late summer or early fall 2018. Again, the model is available in PDF versions in both US letter and A4 (for my European friends).

Note that I did not perform the translations myself so I could perform the necessary reviews with a clearer head. But I've reviewed, discussed and confirmed that the message is the same in all versions.
