I'm happy to announce the release of PCI Resources volume 4 in my series on PCI DSS, entitled "Hypothetical Case Studies", available now in the 
[Amazon kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WRTJNL) (and hopefully in the next few hours in the iBooks store).

You may notice the design change... This will roll out slowly to all volumes and physical book (which will include volume 4 in its next release). So expect updates to the full series this fall (with major revisions to all volumes), and even including French and Spanish translations of all of the volumes in all formats (kindle, ibooks and paper).

Many good things are coming from the PCI Resources side of things. Stay tuned.
